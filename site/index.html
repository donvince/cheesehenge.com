			<p class="subhead">a quest to find a lost page from the internet</p>
		</header>
		<p>Once upon a time, in an internet long ago, before google's mind reading level of search effectiveness, internet pages were diverse, unusual and funny.</p>
		<p>Back then during the late 1990s or early 2000s I remember finding one specific comical page. 
			The (reliable) route to finding the page was convoluted:
			<ul>
				<li>Open Netscape Navigator (RIP)</li>
				<li>Visit the site of search engine altavista.com (RIP)</li>
				<li>Type in an unusual search term</li>
				<li>Click through to result page 12, 13 or 14ish</li>
				<li>Then click the link 3 resuts down that page</li>
			</ul>
			Finding most pages on the internet back then was typically this level of difficulty: Wikipedia wasn't there with most of the answers, google handn't become the only place to search yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			I find it somehow fitting that, having, for whatever reason, recalled this little gem of internet, I found it even more difficult to find.
			Google gave me huge amounts of answers, all exactly what I was asking for but none of which were that particular page I was hoping to find.
			AltaVista has been swallowed up by Yahoo! which was reluctant to give me the answer I was wishing for.
		</p>
		<p>
			Incredibly, via a flash of luck, I found the address of the very site, I'd sent it to a friend via email.
			Alas, the site was no longer there "a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying..."
		</p>
		<p>
			All is not lost, for just such a tragic turn of events, <a href="http://archive.org">the wayback machine</a> was sent to help us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the magic of the archive.org, you can see the archaeological remains of... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tempchin.com/ben-bob/cheesehenge.html">the cheesehenge page!</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The original page included a link to an oracle, which was at the ready to give you random javascript generated predictions. Sadly this was not captured by the wayback machine.
